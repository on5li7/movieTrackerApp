# Project Objectives
Having a working app that would help the users to keep track of their movies, rating, commenting and separating them in different lists like watched, unwatched and plannig to watch.

# Project Design
Having User Interface to show the movies with the title, picture and  rating in the main page. Being able to add/remove movies and move them from one list to another was also an important part of the design.

# Implementation Details
For this project we were using Python Programming Language. The GUI part was done with Graphics.py library.
The main challenge for our project was setting up the back end and database. The way to move the movie details around the different lists, setting the picture on the page were the difficult parts. For that we used the the full path of  the image so that we can directly import that image to the screen. That full path was  provided by the user. 
For moving the movie data around, we decided  the number them in an order in the list and rewrite the database file with that specific line that was supposed to be removed. Later on, that line was saved in a variable and was written to the back of the new database file that it was supposed to be.
# Testing

[Testing](Testing.md)

# Retrospective: Project Highlights
One of the good parts of the software is that it is fully working application with back and front end interfaces. We have implemented database system and the software is very functional that details of the movies are displayed neatly on the menu page. 
One of the main things we were able to implement was pair programming. It generally helped every team member and by doing it we were able to solve the challanges easier and faster than usual. 
The biggest trouble that we figured out was importing the pictures to the screen. Before we tried to find a way that program itself handles uploading the specific image, however, later on the easier solution was providing the path of the image. 

# Retrospective: Things To Be Improved 
We would like to work more on the UI design. It would be nice to make it more visually attractive. Besides that we think that adding more functionalities to the software would also be nice. Right now we are implementing the movie change only from one list to other. It would be nice to add that functionality to other lists as well. On top of that we would also like to add the functionality of uploading the image directly from choosing the Computer Drive (like most of the apps). 

I think for the future it would be better to spend more time on dividing the work in between the team members. This would help us more to be efficient and create better quality software.
# Lessons Learned 
I would say future COMP 129 students should spend more  time on testing their software. Knowing how to work with testing technologies and doing them on time carefully will be very helpful for them in the future.
